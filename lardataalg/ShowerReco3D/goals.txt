Shower Reco Plot Goals

Plots for Tuesday, 9/22/15:
3D Start Point
3D Direction
average dE/dx for electrons, also for photons
energy
profiling/time for computation

Long term goals:
Improve start point
bad cluster tagging
efficiency plots as a function of energy, angle, etc.
space points for start of shower
alternative input than clusters (spacepoints, etc)
reclustering (including matching data products)


Input from analysis:

3D axis resolution requirements from pi0 traceback, neutrino vtx traceback (photon rejection)
dE/dx resolution for e/gamma separation
trackback to tracks for cosmic tagging
track shower separation
  -> ID overlaid showers for cosmics
